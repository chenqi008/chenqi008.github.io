I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), University of Adelaide. I am a member of [V3A Lab](https://v3alab.github.io/). I received my Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Adelaide in 2024, supervised by A/Prof. [Qi Wu](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=aKXe1FEAAAAJ&hl=en) and Asst. Prof. [Yuankai Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mLqg5hYAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my master's degree at South China University of Technology, under the supervision of Prof. [Jian Chen](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%99%88%E5%81%A5/12740630) and Prof. [Mingkui Tan](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=EVsoTGkAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on computer vision, multi-modality, and generative models. I have published several papers in top conferences/journals in artificial intelligence and computer vision, including IEEE-TPAMI/TIP/TMM, CVPR, NeurIPS, ICCV, etc. I also serve as the reviewer for several top-tier conferences and journals including CVPR, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICCV, ECCV, TPAMI, IJCV, etc.
