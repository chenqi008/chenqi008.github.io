I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_for_Machine_Learning), University of Adelaide. I am a member of [V3A Lab](https://v3alab.github.io/). I received my Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Adelaide in 2024, supervised by A/Prof. [Qi Wu](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=aKXe1FEAAAAJ&hl=en) and Asst. Prof. [Yuankai Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mLqg5hYAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my master's degree at South China University of Technology, under the supervision of Prof. [Jian Chen](https://dblp.org/pid/49/6002-11.html) and Prof. [Mingkui Tan](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=EVsoTGkAAAAJ&hl=en).

<!-- My research focuses on computer vision, multi-modality, and generative models. I have published several papers in top conferences/journals in artificial intelligence and computer vision, including IEEE-TPAMI/TIP/TMM, CVPR, NeurIPS, ICCV, etc. I also serve as the reviewer for several top-tier conferences and journals including CVPR, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICCV, ECCV, TPAMI, IJCV, etc. -->
My research focuses mainly on Controllable Generative AI for Multi-modality, (Multimodal) Large Language Models (LLMs), and Multimodal AI for Real-world Applications/Domains (e.g., Medicine, Architecture, and the Internet). I have over 20 peer-reviewed publications, most in flagship journals/conference proceedings, including IEEE-TPAMI/TIP/TMM, CVPR, NeurIPS, ICCV, etc. His research has attracted over 1,100 citations with an H-index of 14 (Google Scholar). I also serve as a reviewer for top-tier journals/conference proceedings, including Nature Communications, IEEE-TPAMI, IJCV, CVPR, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICCV, ECCV, etc.
