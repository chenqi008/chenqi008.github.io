I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), University of Adelaide. I received my Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Adelaide in 2024. My research focuses on computer vision, multi-modality, and generative models. I have published several papers in top conferences/journals in artificial intelligence and computer vision, including IEEE-TPAMI/TIP/TMM, CVPR, NeurIPS, ICCV, etc. I also serve as the reviewer for several top-tier conferences and journals including CVPR, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICCV, ECCV, TPAMI, IJCV, etc.
